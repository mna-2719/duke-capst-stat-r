Coursera Course Quiz & Project

The capstone project was an analysis using R that answers a specific scientific/business question provided by the course team. A large and complex dataset was provided and the analysis required the application of a variety of methods and techniques introduced in the previous courses, including exploratory data analysis through data visualization and numerical summaries, statistical inference, and modeling as well as interpretations of these results in the context of the data and the research question. The analysis implements both frequentist and Bayesian techniques and discuss in context of the data how these two approaches were similar and different, and what these differences mean for conclusions that could be drawn from the data.
